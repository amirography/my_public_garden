# Mary the color scientist
In this entry I will use Mary, the color scientist thought experiment, in order to pin point consciousness and make sure that we are on the same page when we refer to consciousness. 

In This short post, I will introduce you to a thought experience, introduced by [Frank Jackson](https://doi.org/10.2307/2960077). The aim of this entry is to pin point consciousness and make sure that we are on the same page when we refer to consciousness and qualia. 

Mary is a scientist. Her subject of interest? Colors. And She has found out everything that science can ever offer about how our brains perceive color. And I mean every neuron that is correlated, every molecule that would ever form a neuron. He knowledge about cognitive neuroscience and physics of color perception and colors is unimaginable. 

But there is a catch.  She is lock up in black and white room. And She always was. As such she has never ever seen the color red. Some day, the evil monster that locked her up in that room, opens up the room. And Mary, the heroin of our story, walks out. And The first thing she sees is a red apple. 

up until that moment, she has known every, single, thing, that science could offer her about the red. She has even read every human's description of the color red. And she knows that the moment she sees red, how she would describe it. And how molecules in her brain changes. So, what could seeing the color red, offer her that she doesn't already have? [^1]

At the moment that Mary experiences something. She experience the color red. The difference between Mary after the experience of the color red and the Mary before, is an information. The information like the information that we are talking about is something that philosopher's of mind call **qualia**.

**Qualia is the quality of experience that we have in our consciousness. Qualias are the building blocks that make all the contents of our conscious experience.**


[^1]: In the literature Mary's thought experiment was originally used in what is called [the knowledge argument](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/). Which is an standalone criticism of physicallism. However, I found Mary's thought experiment more useful in order to pinpoint qualia.
