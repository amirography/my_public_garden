# The garden:
## mind stuff
I suggest that before reading other materials from this section, you should first read here. 
1. first you should know what I mean by phenomenal consciousness.
   1. Let's use [[mary_the_color_scientist|Mary the color scientist]] as a starting point.  

2. Physicalism and materialism are extremely problematic positions to hold and physicalism cannot answer how we have consciousness. 
3. I will assert that Panpsychism is probably the best position to hold. 

### Ethics
1. I assert that we cannot have realist normative schools, rather they are preferences. 
2. I prefer utilitarianism.
3. I assert that science is absolutely neccessary to be good person. 
4. I assert that we are deterministic beings. That means that we don't responsibility. which also means that punishment as justic systems are using, is barbaric.
