                     1. Input---process--->output
                     2. And that's all there is to it.

                         1. science will fix it
                             1. science needs a theory and it doesn't have it
                         2. we will never know
                             1. then why should we hold that consciousness is material if we don't have a proof or reason or even theory
                 2. Neutral monism
                     1. no material or physical properties either

                         1. two emergence
