# Why physicalism cannot explain consciousness
[[mary_the_color_scientist|You should read]] the story of Mary, the wonderful color scientist that never saw color red, until she already knew all the knowledge she could have empirically (using data that can be observed through evidence: including others description of the experience of seeing red) about it. I also said that the experience I was talking about was called a **qualia**. A qualia is any instance of subjective experience in our consciousness. Basically we can roughly say that qualia is the building block of our conscious experience. But let's not get lost in defining this term. I guess you know what I mean. 

However, qualia is problematic for our common scientific conception of the universe. One of the most unquestioned assumptions that most of scientists and probably a great proportion of the people make, is physicalism. Physicalism is a doctrine.  It is a belief in these dictums:
1. Everything is made up of non-conscious stuff
2. Every action that things do, can be explained by the actions that their constituting parts do.

So, no, it doesn't really mean a belief in science or the belief that physical science work but often accompanies with the belief in science as well. 
This doctrine seems pretty logical. It is empirically unfalsifiable[^1]. But we have had no reason to doubt it, for consciousness.  Now let me explain why. 
Let's say that you are a physicallist and you believe that one day using the current paradigm of science we will be able to explain the red qualia. So this means that you believe that Interaction of our neurons (the cells that are most responsible for our thinking, information processing and mind) in someway is or cause the qualia of red. 
You also agree that not all of what our brain does is conscious[^2].  Which means that not all neurons actually cause consciousness. So There are specific neurons through out our brain that when they interact they produce or is a conscious experience. Let's call them Consciousness neurons. Also in certain part of sleep-cycle and during epileptic seizures these neurons also get activated, but we don't have a consciousness during that time. So these neurons  have to actually have a very specific interaction with each other that cause them to produce/be conscious.

So we do some super futuristic advanced imagery and find out that when people experience the color Yellow, These neurons get activated [^3] :

And when people experience red, They see activation pattern like this:
![neuronal pattern of red objects](/assets/consciousness-neurons-red-e.svg#center)
Now, let me ask you this: How do these scientists know that all these patterns of activity causes/is the color yellow or the color red?
What they can do is show some one a card or a picture of what everyone agree is a yellow and see which neurons get activated in which way.  And a picture of what everyone agrees is red. 

so something like this: 
![Red and Yellow cards](/assets/red-and-yellow-cards-e.svg#center)
But there is a problem with that. Consider how we learn about how we learn about colors. Our parents, our teachers and everybody else, show us an object and say that: "It is yellow." or "It is red". And we learn that the name of the qualia of the color that comes when we see bananas and lemons is yellow. And for qualia cause by strawberry and blood, it is red. But how can I know the qualia I experience from seeing red objects is the same qualia that you have. 

For example you experience the world seeing it like this:

But for me, it is something like this: 
![fruit bowl by Rebecca Hanse-modified](/assets/rebecca-hansen-shifted.jpg#center)
I every time I see a strawberry, a qualia raises in me for its color that is raised in you for the color of banana.  And The banana would raise the color qualia that would be identical to  the color qualia that would raise for you when you see leaf.

How would the scientists or anyone ever know that? You may propose that the pattern of neuronal activity in our brains may be an indicator of. Maybe if a scientist look at my brain, they would see that when I experience a qualia for the red objects, the pattern of activity would be the same pattern of activity that you would have for the yellow objects. But how would they know? Remember that the pattern of activity in itself doesn't show us a reddish or yellowish feeling. And that the scientists are asking us to declare them what color qualia we are seeing. So here, we are making a circular argument[^4] : 
![Circular reasoning of consciousness scientists](/assets/circular-reasoning-e.svg#center)

And yet if we don't ask the participants, we have no other way of investigating those qualias. We don't have any similar problems in investigating any other causal problems. (I will further investigate that problem in a separate post. ) In principle, I can say that a person acted this way because of these set of natural physical processes, the only obstacle is technological and scientific knowledge that may be obtained, in future. But there is no way a quality like redness can be seen the activity of neurons (Do you see any reddish quality when you watch the reddish-qualia-neurons?). Or can be explained just by a qualia-less, conscious-less processes. So what does physicallists have as a solution?

There are two main solutions:
1. The perspective argument
2. The illusionism
 
 I will link this entry with them them as soon as possible. 

[^1]: The explanation that follows is not necessary for the argument, however for those of you with more technical understanding, I believe I have to justify my choice of word as well: You might say that our experience of consciousness may falsify it (as I explained in the rest of article) but you have to consider that empirical means a direct or indirect  third- person observation by means of our sense. However, our experience of consciousness is not itself a third person observation. But empirical observations **are** part of the content of our consciousness. 
[^2]: We don't have any experience of how are v1 and v2 and much of our brain do their job, we just observe the results and get amazed of what we have lost when they don't
[^3]: It is actually extremely more complicated than this, but for the sake of argument, I simplified it. I promise: those complications don't have any argumentative weight for or against my point.
[^4]: You might ask what's the problem with that. Imagine that I tell you, that Jesus is the son prophet of the God. And you ask me "How do you know that?". I answer : "Because God said it!" You may ask: "How do you know God said it?" And I tell you: "Because Jesus said it!" At this point you may think that I'm missing something (As scientists that do the aforementioned kind of experiments are). And you would be true. I'm relying my claim on another claim is reliant on the claim that I'm trying to prove in the first place. So I could make any claim, and all I need to prove it is some other fictitious claim.
